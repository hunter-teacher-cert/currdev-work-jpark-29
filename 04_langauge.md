## 1. What is the course? (grade level, student experience)
* Course title: Introduction to Programming for Games
* Grade level: 11-12
* Student experience: Students will learn the concepts of computer programming and their applications to the creation of video games. 

## 2. What is the language?
* Processing with Java
  
## 3. How does one write & run code in this language?
* The Processing application has to be downloaded where one can write and run code.
  
## 4. Rate the complexity of the syntax?
* The syntax is not as complex especially when students come from other text-based programming language courses.
  
## 5. Strengths
* It is free and easy to intall. 
* With its focus on creating visual, it is motivating for students to see their code creating something visual immediately on their screen.
* It is well documented with many examples, resources, and tutorials.
* Wide range of difficulty level and complexity for projects.
  
## 6. How would you utlilize the strengths in the class?
* Since students can see what they code in their screen with its visual presentation, it would be easier to scaffold for complex game development.  
* With a wide range of difficulty levels, the curriculum can be flexible depending on the student level.

## 7. Weaknesses
* It requires a seprate program to be downloaded but some of my students only have the school Chromebook where they can't download a separate program. Therefore, the only time that they can work on the projects may be the class time. 

## 8. How would you mitigate the weaknesses in the class?
* Have the students work on projects only in class and not assign homework. 

## 9. Why did you select this language for this class?
* Since this is an introductory class for game development, it is appropriate for them to create simple games using Processing and understand the basic scope of a digital game.
