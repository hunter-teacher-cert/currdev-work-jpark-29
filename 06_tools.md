Desribe 2 technological tools you currently use in your classroom. One of which should be a programming tool (if possible). Include:

- The name of the tool : Replit
- What its general purpose is: IDE; for students to write their program code and run it
- The class(es) you use it in: AP CSA
- How you use it in class: I use it to demo new concepts/topics and for students to practice what they learned that day. 
- Why you have selected that tool for that purpose? Since it's online IDE, I like how I can create assignements in it and easily access my students' work.

- The name of the tool : desmos
- What its general purpose is: online graphing calculator; it allows me to easily show graphs for sepcific functions in my math classes
- The class(es) you use it in: Algebra 2
- How you use it in class: when I want to show my students quick graphs of polynomial functions or system of equations or functions that require quick manipulation to see the characteristics of the function, I like to use desmos since it's color coded and intuitive.  
- Why you have selected that tool for that purpose? It's very intuitive and easy to present graphs to the class. I like that it allows the students to see the immediate effects of manipulations of functions.
